Our research group focuses on ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic determinants of species distributions. We do this by measuring physiological, morphological, and anatomical functional traits across many species. We are located at the [Department of Biology at the University of Miami](https://biology.as.miami.edu/) in Coral Gables, FL.

Recently, we have been working on many different projects, spanning from termites and fungi to lignin and solar radiation! With COVID-19 preventing many of our classic in-person lab activities, we have gotten creative in staying connected and inspired to learn more about the ecological systems around us. We have been running weekly Zoom lab meetings, discussing current literature in ecology as well as diversity and inclusion. Additionally, we have taken to the lab Slack channel to share photos of our latest creations in the kitchen, as well as lighthearted science humor that is oh so necessary in these times! 

While classes take on a different form, we have been cleverly adapting to the online learning format, pursuing interactive R programming sessions as well as bringing in a diverse array of invited speakers from all different scientific backgrounds. Even while some of our international collaborations are on hold when it comes to research, we are still working the best we can with local collaborators in the DMV area to continually ask questions about carbon cycling, forest nutrient dynamics, and decomposition (see [Research](research)).

We are located at the University of Miami, surrounded by plenty of tropical biology. We love to exchange ideas and work with our partners from [The Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu/), as well as with the colleagues from the [Smithsonian Environmental Research Center](https://serc.si.edu/) and the [Natural History Museum in London](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/).
