Our research group focuses on interactions among plants, microbes and insects, and how they affect carbon cycling under current and future projected climates. To explore these questions, we also study ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic determinants of species distributions by measuring physiological, morphological, and anatomical functional traits. We explore ecosystem-level consequences of differences in species and trait distributions, for instance, traits of plants, microbes and insects that most affect rates and forms of C release with feedback to the earth system.

We ask these biogeochemical and macroevolutionary questions at the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/) in Millbrook, NY and in the [Department of Biology at the University of Miami](https://biology.as.miami.edu/) in Coral Gables, FL.

For the 2024 North hemisphere summer, the Zanne Lab has many projects underway all over the map. Amy is attending various meetings the USA, Brazil and Chile, as she builds up projects in the Brazilian Cerrado, Chilean fjords and Patagonia and Antarctica. She is also putting on her New Phytologist Editor’s hat, joining both the next generation scientists and plant-fungal invasions meetings. She will be shifting lab headquarters up to Cary Institute this summer. 
<br />
<br />
Abbey (5th year PhD student) completed her fieldwork in Queensland, Australia and is avidly analyzing data and writing papers on internal stem damage of trees and termite mound carbon dioxide and methane fluxes. She was recently awarded NSF GRFP INTERN funding to spend 6 months based with <a href="https://www.arbormeta.au/">ArborMeta</a>, learning the fundamentals of LiDAR in forest research. 
<br />
<br />
Yuri (3rd year PhD student) is conducting his second fieldwork campaign in the Brazilian Cerrado. Yuri is sampling lots of termites, plants and soils from the ground and air to understand how murundus (earthmounds) alter the ecosystem. He recently passed his qualifying exams and is working on his dissertation proposal and his first chapter on termite surveys from the Cerrado.
<br />  
<br />
Baptiste (Postdoc) is coordinating several global literature compilation and experimental data collection studies on termite mound properties. He’s also rapidly writing up projects on Australian wood decay. He will join Amy and Yuri in Brazil for the New Phytologist plant-fungal invasions meeting and tour the Cerrado. He will be shifting his base back to Australia this summer.
