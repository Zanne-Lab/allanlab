# Open positions

We are always looking for undergraduate and graduate students to join our ecology and evolution research group! Many in our group are exploring how plant construction influences community structure and function (from morphology to genes and transcripts) of biotic decay agents (e.g., microbes and termites). Our lab wants to udnerstand the consequences of these interactions for the forest carbon cycle, especially as our climate changes. Other lab projects include exploring microbiota assembly on leaves and fruits, and using global functional trait databases to explore ecology and evolution of fungi and plants.

The student would join an interactive lab group that broadly focuses on plant, microbe and termite structure and function (anatomy and physiological ecology), community ecology, and evolutionary ecology in both temperate and tropical areas. Field projects are currently primarily based in the US, Australia, and Brazil. The graduate work will be completed at the University of Miami, located in Coral Gables in Miami-Dade county, with easy access to numerous tropical botanical gardens and science outreach institutions.

### Applications for PhD students
If you are interested in doing graduate work with us, please send an email to me (Amy Zanne: aezanne@gmail.com) with brief details about your GP, research interests and experience, and why you want to go to graduate school. For information about applying to the program, go to the University of Miami Department of Biology website. The application deadline is early December. I am also happy to answer any questions you might have. For undergraduates, please send me brief details about your GPA, research interests, experience, and what you hope to do in the future.

For graduate students, we encourage you to take a look at the [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) for external funding sources.

### Postdoc opportunities
We will have a postdoc position opening up in the near future - please contact aezanne@gmail.com if interested. Additional information will be posted soon!

### University of Miami undergraduate students
If you are an undergraduate student at the University of Miami looking for research experience, contact me (or any team member) via email or stop by my office (204A Cox). We would love to learn about what interests you in ecology and global change, and how we can help you grow! 

Additionally, University of Miami biology undergraduates have the opportunity to pursue a combined Bs/Ms program. Qualified students may pursue the combined degree program to complete a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Master of Science in Biology within five years. The accelerated program allows students to complete some graduate credits as part of their undergraduate program. If you are interested in pursuing this program, check out more information from the UM Biology webpage [here](https://biology.as.miami.edu/graduate/bs-ms-program-in-biology/index.html).
