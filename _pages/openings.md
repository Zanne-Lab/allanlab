We currently do not have any open positions for people to join the lab, although we are always looking for collaborations and hosting lab visitors. With the shift to Cary Institute, Amy is no longer at a degree granting institute so cannot advise graduate and undergraduate students; however, she can serve on student committees. Reach out if that is of interest.

We are an interactive lab group. Broadly we study how biotic interactions impact biogeochemical cycles. Many in our group explore how plant construction influences community structure and function (from morphology to genes) of biotic decay agents. Our lab also examines the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem carbon cycles, especially as climate changes. Field projects are currently primarily based in the USA, Australia, and Brazil, Chile and Antarctica. Other lab projects include solar radiation impacts on litter and wood decay, microbiome assembly on leaves and fruits, macroevolution and functional ecology of plants, and termites and microbes around the globe.
