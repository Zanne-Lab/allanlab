We have open positions for graduate students to join the lab. We are also always looking for undergraduate students to join our group! Successful applicants would join an interactive lab group. Broadly we study how biotic interactions impact biogeochemical cycles. Many in our group explore how plant construction influences community structure and function (from morphology to genes) of biotic decay agents. Our lab also examines the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem carbon cycles, especially as climate changes. Field projects are currently primarily based in the US, Australia, and Brazil. Other lab projects include solar radiation impacts on litter and wood decay, microbiome assembly on leaves and fruits, macroevolution and functional ecology of plants, and termites and microbes around the globe.



### Applications for PhD students
Students will develop an independent research focus in line with ongoing lab projects. Graduate work will be completed at the University of Miami, located in Coral Gables, FL, with easy access to numerous tropical botanical gardens and science outreach institutions. If you are interested in doing graduate work with us, please send an email to me (Amy Zanne: aezanne@gmail.com) with brief details about your GPA, research interests and experiences, why our group is a fit for you and why you want to go to graduate school. For information about applying to the program, go to the University of Miami, [Department of Biology website](https://biology.as.miami.edu/graduate/index.html). The graduate application deadline is December 1. I am also happy to answer any questions you might have. While the University of Miami has good student support, we also encourage you to consider the [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

### University of Miami undergraduate students
If you are an undergraduate student at the University of Miami looking for research experience, contact me (Amy Zanne: aezanne@gmail.com, or any team member) via email. Send us brief details about your GPA, research interests, experience, and what you hope to do in the future.

Additionally, University of Miami biology undergraduates have the opportunity to pursue a combined BS/MS program. Qualified students may pursue the combined degree program to complete a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Master of Science in Biology within five years. The accelerated program allows students to complete some graduate credits as part of their undergraduate program. If you are interested in pursuing this program, check out more information from the UM Biology webpage  [here](https://biology.as.miami.edu/graduate/bs-ms-program-in-biology/index.html).
