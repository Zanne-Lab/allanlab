- title: "Shifts in internal stem damage along a tropical precipitation gradient and implications for forest biomass estimation"
  image: NP_2024.jpeg
  description: We investigated internal stem damage across five sites in tropical Australia along a precipitation gradient. We estimated the amount of internal aboveground biomass damaged in living trees and measured four potential stem damage predictors. Stem damage increased with increasing diameter, wood density, and termite pressure and decreased with increasing precipitation. High wood density stems sustained less damage in wet sites and more damage in dry sites, likely a result of shifting decomposer communities and their differing responses to changes in tree species and wood traits across sites.

- title: "Wood traits explain microbial but not termite-driven decay in Australian tropical rainforest and savanna"
  image: woodtraits.jpeg
  description: Ecosystem-scale predictions of deadwood turnover and carbon storage should account for the impact of wood traits on decomposer communities. In tropical Australia, termite-driven decay was lower than expected for native wood on the ground. Even if termites are present, they may not always increase decomposition rates of fallen native wood in tropical forests. Our study shows how the drivers of wood decay differ between Australian tropical rainforest and savanna; further research should test whether such differences apply world-wide.

- title: "Beyond the usual climate? Factors determining flowering and fruiting phenology across a genus over 117 years"
  image: flowerfruiting.jpeg
  description: Although changes in plant phenology are largely attributed to changes in climate, the roles of other factors such as genetic constraints, competition, and self-compatibility are underexplored. Spring precipitation and other climate-related factors were dominant predictors of phenological variance. Our results emphasize the strong effect of precipitation on phenology, especially in the moisture-limited habitats preferred by Leavenworthia. Among the many factors that determine phenology, climate is the dominant influence, indicating that the effects of climate change on phenology are expected to increase.

- title: "Symbiotic status alters fungal eco-evolutionary offspring trajectories"
  image: ecolett.png
  description: Despite  host-fungal  symbiotic  interactions  being  ubiquitous  in  all  ecosystems,  understanding how symbiosis has shaped the ecology and evolution of fungal spores that are involved in dispersal and colonization of their hosts has been ignored in life-history  studies.  In this study, symbiotic status explained more variation than climatic  variables  in  the  current  distribution  of  spore  sizes  of  plant-associated  fungi  at  a  global  scale  while  the  dispersal  potential  of  their  spores  is  more  restricted  compared  to  free-living  fungi.  Our  work  advances  life-history  theory  by highlighting how the interaction between symbiosis and offspring morphology shapes the reproductive and dispersal strategies among living forms.

- title: "Termite sensitivity to temperature affects global wood decay rates"
  image: science.png
  description: Decomposition rates vary with temperature and precipitation, in part because of the effects of climate on decomposer organisms. Although microbes are widely recognized as decomposers, animals such as insects also play a key role in tropical systems. This global study quantifies climate-related variation in wood decomposition by both microbes and termites. Climate influenced both microbial and termite decomposition, but termite presence and activity were more sensitive to temperature. Termites may thus play a larger role in global wood decomposition as the climate warms.

  description: Microbial community structure varied more strongly with wood traits than with spatial locations, mirroring the relative role of these factors on decay rates on the same pieces of wood even after 5 years. Co‐occurring fungal and bacterial communities persistently influenced one another independently from their shared environmental conditions.
