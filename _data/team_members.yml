  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in decomposition rates in different habitats. 
  education2: Favorite species? Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) - the tree that makes for both the most magical sights and sounds!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Vegan banana bread (the more bananas and chocolate chips, the better)

  education1: My broad interests are comprehending the Anthropoceneâ€™s consequences on organisms and environmental maintenance. Most of my research has focused on understanding how populations, communities, and ecosystems respond to human disturbances from different perspectives. My current interest is understanding how termites might affect below and above-ground processes through tropic cascades."
  education2: Favorite species? Spectacled Owl. This owl has a strong singing call and a funny staring face.
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Pasta and pizza!
