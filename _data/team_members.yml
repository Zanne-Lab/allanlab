  education1: I am interested in understanding abrupt changes in ecosystems, what causes them, and how they can be predicted. To do so, I use remote sensing and advanced time series analyses.
  education2: Favorite species? Philcoxia minensis! (Have you ever seen a plant with underground leaves?!)
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? All sorts of pasta. I would eat pasta every day if I could.

  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in decomposition rates in different habitats. 
  education2: Favorite species? Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) - the tree that makes for both the most magical sights and sounds!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Vegan banana bread (the more bananas and chocolate chips, the better)

  education1: My interests rely broadly on understanding ecosystem ecology, how species interact with each other, and how these interactions, in turn, affect and shape the environment. Right now, I am studying termites and their contribution to global diversity and to soil structure.  
  education2: Favorite species? Striped Owl. This owl has a strong singing call and a funny staring face.
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Rice, Pasta, and pizza!

  education1: I am interested in studying how wood traits respond to climate and atmospheric changes over time, specifically within various environmental conditions. Also, my interests extend to tropical forest management and the diverse applications of dendrochronology in multidisciplinary settings.
  education2: Favorite species? Handroanthus impetiginosus
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Any kind of pasta, with or without sauce.

  education1: I am interested in understanding how ecosystems function and how plants influence these processes. Additionally, I aim to apply this knowledge in applied efforts such as restoration ecology. Recently, I have been focusing on carbon dynamics in wetlands and am passionate about these incredible ecosystems!
  education2: Favorite species? Loudetiopsis chrysothrix. This small grass has amazing golden colors and an inflorescence that looks like an earring. 
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Brazilian pão de queijo — a small bread filled with lots of cheese.
