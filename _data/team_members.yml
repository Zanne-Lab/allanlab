  education1: I am interested in understanding abrupt changes in ecosystems, what causes them, and how they can be predicted. To do so, I use remote sensing and advanced time series analyses.
  education2: Favorite species? Philcoxia minensis! (Have you ever seen a plant with underground leaves?!)
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? All sorts of pasta. I would eat pasta every day if I could.

  education1: I am interested in how carbon cycles within trees of savanna ecosystems. My dissertation research is focused on measuring wood decomposition occuring within trees as well as quantifying methane emissions coming from termite mounds.
  education2: Favorite species? For plants, the quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and for animals, I love eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis)!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Sourdough bread of all forms (stay tuned for my bakery opening...)

  education1: My interests rely broadly on understanding ecosystem ecology, how species interact with each other, and how these interactions, in turn, affect and shape the environment. Right now, I am studying termites and their contribution to global diversity and to soil structure.  
  education2: Favorite species? Striped Owl. This owl has a strong singing call and a funny staring face.
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Rice, Pasta, and pizza!

  education1: I am interested in understanding how ecosystems function and how plants influence these processes. Additionally, I aim to apply this knowledge in applied efforts such as restoration ecology. Recently, I have been focusing on carbon dynamics in wetlands and am passionate about these incredible ecosystems!
  education2: Favorite species? Loudetiopsis chrysothrix. This small grass has amazing golden colors and an inflorescence that looks like an earring.
