  education1: I am interested in the evolution and community ecology of insects, especially termites. I love learning about the role that termites play in decomposition and carbon cycling. I am also interested in urban ecology and the ways that insects adapt to living in cities.
  education2: Favorite species? Nasutitermes magnus (nasute termites)
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Veggie burgers

  education1: By developing novel carbon flux systems, I hope to understand short- and long-term changes to carbon cycling in urban systems, patchy ecosystems and marine-terrestrial interfaces. It is especially important to understand carbon cycling across marine-terrestrial gradients, as these areas are seeing some of the most intense environmental changes and disturbances.

  education1: I am currently involved in projects that assess how plant-soil feedbacks influence vegetation structure, organic matter turnover and restoration success of the Brazilian Cerrado. 
  education2: Favorite species? Vochysia thyrsoidea (locally called gomeira), a typical tree species that grows in dystrophic and shallow soil in the Brazilian Cerrado.

  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in deomposition rates in different habitats. 
  education2: Favorite species? Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) - the tree that makes for both the most magical sights and sounds!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Vegan banana bread (the more bananas and chocolate chips, the better)

  education1: My current project centers on the mechanisms and predictors of flower phenology shifts. Other research interests include investigating the implications of global change on plant distribution and ecosystem function.
  education2: Favorite species? My favorite species is probably desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), but the red columbine is a close second (Aquilegia canadensis)!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Lasagna and blackberry scones
