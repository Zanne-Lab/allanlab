  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in decomposition rates in savanna habitats. 
  education2: Favorite species? Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) - the tree that makes for both the most magical sights and sounds!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Vegan banana bread (the more bananas and chocolate chips, the better)
